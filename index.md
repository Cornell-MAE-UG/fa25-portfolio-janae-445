## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/github-profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a mechanical engineering major who learns best by being hands on. I like machining, testing, and building systems because seeing how something actually works helps everything click for me. Over time I’ve built a solid base in mechanical and manufacturing concepts, and learning more about lean has pushed me to think about how processes can be cleaner and more efficient. I enjoy practical work where I can apply what I know, pick up new skills, and make steady improvements.

I’m especially interested in manufacturing and factory environments, and I’ve always had a natural pull toward automotive work. I like understanding how things are made, what keeps production moving, and how small adjustments can make a big difference in performance. Basketball shaped how I communicate and work with others, and that carries into how I approach engineering problems. I want to keep growing in spaces where hands-on work, problem solving, and teamwork matter every day.
